# backslash-n
A 42 project meant to Get the Next Line '\n'

The aim of this project was to allow me to build my own mechanism to access the next line in a certain file through determined file descriptor. The main lessons learned from this project were about the use of static variables and the understanding of mechanisms to find and avoid memory leaks (yes, we met valgrind for the first time here, now I guess we are almost close friends).
